# Bloodlines ARCHIVE

Aasimar and Bloodlines (not ReWritten) REQUIRE Player_animation_lib (Curseforge).

OLDEST: Aasimar

totally glitchy, poor variable assignment, but still fun to mess around with

MIDDLE CHILD: Bloodlines

Pretty glitchy, the variables started to get out of hand, to the point where it became easier to rewrite the mod. That '3-5 variables per route' aproach didn't work out too well wwhen I got up to 4 BLOODLINES.

NEW: Bloodlines Rewritten

The upgraded mod! Actually working, and 4 variables: "bloodline", "level", "ability1 cooldown", and "ability2 cooldown". Also features less clunky gius and overall better code. This is also where I b egan to switch off of MCreator.
