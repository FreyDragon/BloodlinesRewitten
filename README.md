# BloodlinesRewitten
A minecraft mod, like Origins, but for Forge and more progresson-based and includes level system. 
Please do not reupload this without permission. 
I used Mcreator to create the base of the mod.

This mod currently has a few Bloodlines to choose from:

Aasimar

Ender

Faeri

Merfolk

Draconi

I rewrote this mod on 10/12/22, to fix the optimization issues and the sheer quantity of onLoadedEntityTick functions and unneccesary variables. I fixed the variables from being "IsAngelic", "IsDraconic", or "IsMer" to "Bloodline:'draconic'" "Bloodline: 'aasimar'" or "Bloodline: 'mer'". This makes it INFINITELY easier to expand the mod. I added Ender and Faeri in under 20 minutes! Also, I added more progression to bloodlines other than Aasimar, as well as nerfing Aasimar and Draconi a significant amount. I also added cooldowns to ALL abilities, so I could make the mod slightly less overpowered. I added more abilities and made the bloodlines selectable at the start instead of obtained with items.


Here are some abilities and buffs per level and Bloodline:


Aasimar:

Level 1:

Can gain fire resistance for 30s, and heal and feed, cooldown 1min

Level 2:

Permanent extra row of hearts.

Level 3:

Can shoot Fireballs and gain Strenght (cooldown 1min)


Ender:

Level 1:

Can shoot Ender Pearls and Regenerate (cooldown 6s)

Level 2:

Level 3:

Faeri:

Level 1:

Can buff slightly.

Level 2:

Immune to fire.

Level 3:

Can buff insane amounts for a short period. (cooldown 30s)



Merfolk:

Level 1:

Can gain haste
Infinite Water Breathing.

Level 2:

Infinite Regen in water.

Level 3:

Infinite resistance in water, more regen.
Can gain strength


Draconi:

Level 1:

Can shoot Dragon Fireballs (cooldown 30s)

Level 2:

No longer needs to eat.

Level 3:

Can gain Resistance for a reasonable period of time


Some bloodlines also have weaknesses (so they aren't COMPLETELY broken).

Mer: Can't breathe on land.

Faeri: Can't wear armor.

Ender: can't swim or touch water.


Have fun if you decide to play the mod!
